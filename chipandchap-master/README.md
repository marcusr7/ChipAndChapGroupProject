# Game instructions

1. The main methid in the RunGame() (application.RunGame package) is used to run the game

2. JSON can be saved by pressing the either CTRL-S or CTRL-K (either works). The game will be closed and the file will be written to LastSavedState.json

3. The last saved state can be loaded from the menu bar at the top of the main menu (window that launches before game is launched)

4. The JSON libraries needed to be added to the project build path. They are provided in the JARs.zip file (both JARs need to be added as an external library).

5. If main menu doesn't pop up, delete the launchInfo.json file and relaunch the game
